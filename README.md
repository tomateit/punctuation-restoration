# Punctuation restoration

This is a research project on punctuation restoration methods.  
First of all, I have big expectation from using seq2seq models, so I gonna use em first.

Refer to notebooks folder to see my pity attempts :)

If my research will be successful, I will do a library. The code in this repo is not intended for outside usage as third-party code. Link to the lib will be posted as soon, as it will be ready.
